This application was a thesis project for our 4th year in De La Salle University - Dasmarinas.
It is an amobile application that using SVM prediction to predict if a patient is at risk of covid-19 or not.
It uses an API as form of bridge to connect between the mobile application and the machine learning prediction.
The mobile application was developed in Android Studio with the help of flutter.
The machine learning program is SVM based prediction that was developed in Jupyter Notebook and was then exported.
The API is a Python based code uploaded to a cloud service website where the data from the mobile application is processed and then sent back.
